  GNU shtool -- The GNU Portable Shell Tool
  ____________________________________________________________________

  INSTALLATION

  Usually you want to use shtool inside the source tree of your own free
  software package (say it stays under /path/to/mypkg). For this you first
  have compile the `shtool' script and then just copy it over to your own
  source tree. To achieve this run in your shell:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ cp shtool /path/to/mypkg/shtool

  Additionally you can use `shtoolize' to first assemble a custom `shtool'
  script (here with the modules `install', `mkdir' and `tarball':

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ shtoolize install mkdir tarball
    $ cp shtool /path/to/mypkg/shtool

  Also please notice the license terms which apply to the generated shtool
  program. You can find them at the top of the generated shtool program file.

  Alternatively you can also install shtool in a system wide location (for
  easier upgrading from there or to make shtool available for users from
  within the shell). To install shtool into /path/to/shtool/{bin,man}/ perform
  the following steps in your shell:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/shtool
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

  Please keep in mind that although the building of `shtool' requires Perl 5
  the generated `shtool' script does _NOT_ require Perl under runtime, of
  course.
